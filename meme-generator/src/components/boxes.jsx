     * HOW IT ALL WORKS â†“
     * - - - - -
     * boxes.jsx receives the data from the data file (aka "boxData")
     * boxes.js has a state arrayBoxes which defaults to the data
     * 
     * the boxes' data is sent through props to the child component
     * is rendered one child component per box
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * the toggle function takes as parameter "id"
     * id comes from the child comp, which is = to the key but passed as id seperatly
     * id allows to identify each component, hence changing them individually
     * 
     * toggle changes the state value to a new empty array
     * that array receives all the boxes objects contained in the state data
     * and for the one box that has been clicked on (identifiable with its id),
     * it swaps its .on status value
     * toggle then returns the whole empty array (no longer empty)
     * and making it the new state value
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * the toggle function is passed as a prop to each child component
     * child comp renders a box with conditionnal style rendering depending on the .on value
     * and has an onClick event listener with the toggle function passed as a prop
     * the toggle func takes in argument props.id
     * 
     * * * * props.id is equal to the "id" parameter as the toggle func is triggered * * *
     * (this is how it sends specific data back to the parent which has all comps mixed)
