     * Challenge:
     * - Create a new component named Count
     *    - It should receive a prop called `number`, whose value
     *      is the current value of our count
     *    - Have the component render the whole div.counter--count
     *      and display the incoming prop `number`
     * - Replace the div.counter--count below with an instance of
     *   the new Count component
