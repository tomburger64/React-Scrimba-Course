# React + Vite

POV: didn't read the instructions properly:
"Copying this project and making it without actually using the API just as the course intends for the following reasons:
- can't use states yet, the course isn't there yet so idk how to manage an "empty" element
- unsuccessfully tried to have a variable = to ' "" ' and then changing itself to the url called from the api

So I'll be cloning this project and doing it the intended way, using an array of objects instead of an API :("

Is what I said but I just realised the challenge explicitely says "don't worry about displaying the image yet"
I guess I divided the exercise in two now, in this folder I made the API call, in the other I used the mock API data



This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


personnal note: Okay 5 seconds in, Vite my beloved ily, wdym I don't have to do the create root thing anymore please marry me
