I started leraning React by myself as this was the first step out of the "HTML & CSS swimming pool" that I was meant to learn in my 2 years of school training, which the school didn't end up teaching at all
But as I really took a liking to the webdev, I decided to take a step forward and start learning React.

Here you'll find small React projects / exercises I do as I follow along Scrimba's free React course. Theoretically once it's done, I should have a certificate but I need to pay for it so I'm good
